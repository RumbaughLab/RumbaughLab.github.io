The Lab has very close collaborations with the Miller Lab on mulitple projects including the development of new medications.

The Miller Lab is working to develop new medications for the treatment of disorders marked by persistent, unwanted memories â€“ specifically substance use disorder (SUD; addiction) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mechanistically, our efforts are large focused on epigenetic and synaptic structural players. [Miller Lab WebSite](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/miller/)
