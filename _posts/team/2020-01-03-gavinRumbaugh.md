The Rumbaugh laboratory is devoted to the understanding of how synapse and circuit mechanisms contribute to cognition and behavioral adaptions. In particular, we are interested in how major neurodevelopmental risk genes (i.e. genes that when mutated cause a defined neurodevelopmental disorder) disrupt synapse function and circuit connectivity. Our approach is to applying cutting edge technology to the study of synapse and circuit function both in vitro and in vivo to determine how major risk genes disrupt behavior and adaptive functions associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Primary Research Areas
* Neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes
* Synapse function and neural circuit connectivity
* Receptors and cell signaling
* Learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity
