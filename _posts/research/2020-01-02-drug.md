* Screening for drug candidates that regulate neurodevelopmental gene expression  
  
* Optimize procedures and workflows  to  determine  the  limit  of  scalability  of  neuron-Â­based  (high throughput screening) HTS  phenotypic  assays  so  that  they  can  easily  support very large campaigns of >200K compounds.  

* Patient-derived neurons expressing _SYNGAP1_ variants will be tested for responses to drug candidates that raise SynGAP protein levels.  

* Understanding how patient mutations in neurodevelopmental risk genes impact brain development:  

	- Cellular biomarkers can be used to guide ongoing drug discovery efforts for SYNGAP1-related brain disorders. Specifically, drug candidates that improve cellular phenotypes common to patient-derived neuronal models would be given the highest priority for further development.
