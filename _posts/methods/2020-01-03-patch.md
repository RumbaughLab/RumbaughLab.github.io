DIC image of patched iNs (induced neuron) at day 30 (left) and day 41 (right). Scale bar represents 20 µm. (B) Example traces of sEPSCs, lower trace displays block of sEPSCs by the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX. C. Characterization of firing pattern in iNs by somatic current injection. D Characterization of of whole-cell voltage-clamp of Na+ currents and K+ currents in iNs.
