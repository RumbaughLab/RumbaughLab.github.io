My laboratory is devoted to the understanding of how synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to memory and cognition. In particular, we are interested in applying cutting edge technology to neurons both in situ and in vivo, which then enable the study of synapse structure and function from a mechanistic perspective at various stages of development. We believe that understanding dysfunction of molecular mechanisms within dendritic spines that control the maturation of synapses will unlock the mysteries of cognitive and social abnormalities.
